This repository is a minimal set of playbooks and inventories required to set up the pithos testnet consisting of execution and 
consensus nodes. 

## Instructions

`pithos-testnet/inventory/group_vars/all.yaml`. Client specific variables are set under e.g `pithos-testnet/inventory/group_vars/eth2client_xxxxxx.yaml`.
The client specific variables also contains the commands used to start the docker image with.
